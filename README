Zimbra provides the ability for administrators of accounts to login and
use delegated authentication which allows administrators to read email from
their assigned accounts.  This simple application will watch the zimbra log
and notify a defined user that the delegated authentication has happened.


Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Clone the repository and once it's been downloaded, either create or copy the
example `zimbra_delagate.ini` file to either your home directory as a hidden
"dot" file or create a directory in `/ect` for `zimbra_delegate` and copy the
example configuration file there.

Example:

.. code-block:: bash

    cp zimbra_delagate.ini ~/.zimbra_delagate.ini


After you move this file into place, use your favorite text editor and fill in
the values based on your environment. When ready, make the file
`zimbra_log_watch.py` executable and then run it.

.. code-block:: bash

    chmod +x zimbra_log_watch.py
    ./zimbra_log_watch.py


While these two steps are the only things that you have to do to get this
running, I recommend that you create a simple init script to run the
application on startup. this can be done in a variety of ways and I've included
one such way in the example file, `zimbra_log_watch.example.init.sh` but you
could also simply add the path to the script in an `/etc/rc.local`. This is
all up to you.
